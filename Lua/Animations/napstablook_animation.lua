-- sanshead.y = 40 --The head's height is relative to the torso it's parented to.

-- --We set the torso's pivot point to halfway horizontally, and on the bottom vertically, 
-- --so we can rotate it around the bottom instead of the center.
-- sanstorso.SetPivot(0.5, 0)

-- --We set the torso's anchor point to the top center. Because the legs are pivoted on the bottom (so rescaling them only makes them move up),
